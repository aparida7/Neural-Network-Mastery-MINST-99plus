# Neural-Network-Mastery-MINST-99plus
**🚀 Project Overview:**
Our aim was to develop neural network models achieving over 99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. We compared convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer neural networks for image classification.

**🔧 Technical Insights:**
Model Experimentation: We experimented with various CNN and transformer architectures, adjusting layers, sizes, and configurations to find optimal setups for high accuracy.
Validation and Analysis: Employing a validation set strategy, we aimed for and achieved >99% accuracy. We analyzed misclassified cases to understand limitations and potentials for improvement.
Web Development with Anvil: We created an interactive web page detailing our project's journey and insights. Users can upload images for classification by our model, facilitating real-time interaction and accessibility.

**🔄 Infrastructure Backbone:**
The project's core is its code, operating seamlessly on an AWS Lightsail instance for high availability and performance. Integration with Anvil's Uplink feature enables real-time interaction with the web application.

**🌐 Interactive Web Application:**
Explore our project through the web application we developed. It serves as a gateway to the technical aspects we explored, providing insights into neural network configurations and real-time image classification.
